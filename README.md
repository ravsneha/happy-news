# Happy News
A news website where you can see regular positive news without news on the pandemic. This site was created to help give positivity to my friends and family who are feeling sad during the COVID crisis. Though the world may change, some things never change, like puppies/kittens/babies being cute and environmental good putting a smile on our faces. 

I made this site using ReactJS and wrote all the styling by myself in SCSS and compiled it down to CSS.
